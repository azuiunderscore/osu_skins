## osu_skins
Compilation of the skin mixes I have used over the years, just so they can all be in one place. These are all mostly mixes, I didn't make most of these elements, just a disclaimer. I'm going to list these in (roughly) chronological order, but some of these I forget when I made exactly

# nep_skin
rly old skin I made at the age of 14? when I was real into hyperdimension neptunia, a decent amount of the elements I created myself I'm pretty sure, most of the gameplay was me I think

# azui_2020
sorta a default+ type skin? idk (I made these circles myself, everything else is a mix)

# blinding_eclipse
my current skin, showing off the different options I built into it 
normal hitcircles
![blinding_eclipse_normal](https://osu.ppy.sh/ss/17941970/c0b6)
rainbow instafades (these are an edit of the rustbell rainbows, to give them a more defined white border, and brighten them up a bit to make them pop a bit more) 
![blinding_eclipse_rainbowinstafades](https://osu.ppy.sh/ss/17941971/1173)
there are more options but I don't really use them and I'm lazy so you'll have to look yourself
