## osu_skins
Compilation of the skin mixes I have used over the years, just so they can all be in one place. These are all mostly mixes, I didn't make most of these elements, just a disclaimer. I'm going to list these in (roughly) chronological order, but some of these I forget when I made exactly

# nep_skin
rly old skin I made at the age of 14? when I was real into hyperdimension neptunia, a decent amount of the elements I created myself I'm pretty sure, most of the gameplay was me I think

# azui_2020
sorta a default+ type skin? idk (I made these circles myself, everything else is a mix)
